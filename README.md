# Trifle Programming Language
Trifle is a dynamically typed general purpose programming language written entirely in JavaScript.  It (with some hacking) works on both the web and in a Node.js environment.  It derives from Ruby, PHP and JavaScript; here's an example:
```
$name = "John Doe";

print("Hello,", $name);
//=> Hello, John Doe
```
