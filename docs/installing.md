Installing Trifle is really simple and only requires Node.js.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Minimum: `v4.x+` Recommended: `v14.7.0`
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes bundled with Node.js)

## Getting Ready
*If you've already installed Node.js and NPM, you can skip this step.*
First of all, we need to check if Node.js is installed correctly.  To do so, run the following command in your terminal of choice:
```sh
node -v
```
